  <h1>AI Questions</h1>

---

<span>Inspired by the repository https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions I created a questionnaire for a couple of topics that fall under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence, covering Basic Techniques and Foundations, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processsing, and Reinforcement Learning.

The purpose of this repository is for you to learn the concepts, refresh your knowledge, or prepare yourself for an interview.

The concept is the same as on Liydia's repo, although I don't provide possible answers. The correct answer can be seen by clicking on the expandable part. 
I'm happy to incorporate feedback, so feel free to drop me a line in case something feels off.
